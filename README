Generates sqlite database of all UMBC SGA Finance Board Requests (sga-fb.sh) and all UMBC OSL Organization Information (orgs.sh).

Depends on elinks and pdftotext (poppler) for Finance Board requests.

Depends on Mojo::DOM for OSL information.

To install perl dependencies locally, simply use the wonderful local::lib in ./perl5/.
